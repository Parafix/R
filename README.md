## Google Analytics - Settings
Script: get an overview of all the accounts, profiles and views with their filters, custom dimensions & custom metrics
<br>Focus: needs some work

## Machine Learning Template
Basic template for machine learning applications and needed/possible steps. Clean sheet.

## Facebook algorithm impact prediction
Script: Predict needed reach based on desired clicks and real historic reach data from past reach campaigns as potential reach indicated by Facebook isn't trust worthy and doesn't allow brands to really invest in market share as they aim to do (TV budget -> GRP build-up vs online budget -> reach build-up).
<br>Model: link clicks models is accurate - first screening: avg. of 6x budget needed to possibly reach the effective potential reach
<br>Focus: done
<br>Technique: Linear regression

## Google Analytics - Seasonality
Script: Check correlation + cross lag impact, decompose trends & seasonality, forecast traffic & show causal impact
<br>Model: accuracy to check
<br>Focus: done

## Google Analytics - Day type corr
Script: Impact of type of day on Revenue - days like: day of week, holiday, closing days, ...
<br>Model: accuracy to check
<br>Focus: done

## Google Analytics - Next Best Content by Page
Script: Market basket analysis based on combined page visits per session (optional: per user-id or client-id)
<br>Model: accuracy to check
<br>Focus: done
<br>Technique: Market basket analysis

## Weather & Google Analytics - Impact of weather
Script: Correlation & prediction of outcome based on weather data & Google Analytics goals
<br>Model: accuracy to check - outliers detection needs to be better -> capping datapoints
<br>Focus: on-going

# Ideas
- Colour codes for graphs based upon book of leila
- Types of graphs based upon book of leila
- Make functions for packages to load, handling data, etc.
- Make markdown of graphs or specific scripts for reporting in pdf 
- Make custom reporting for GA on metrics that really matter - conversion rates, spend/return, weighted, etc.
- Make several machine learning template according to supervised or unsupervised techniques
- Neural network training with tensorflow + output in xls or api? 
- Pipeline management from input, model, output into working environment/database with R or Python

# Services 
- Make the general analytical marketeer and/or its reporting obsolete for GA
